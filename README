Cleanbackup.py is the State News standardized server backup script
It started life as a humble Perl script in 2003 and continued to evolve
from there.

Cleanbackup.py will loop through directories provided in the config file,
tarball them and drop them into the output folder. If database connection
information is provided, it'll dump those too.

After running the backup, the script will then remove any backups (of those
it tracks) that are older than the specified timeout.

See the config file for more information.

Currently only supports MySQLDump for database dumps. SQLite backups are
done by copying the directory.
